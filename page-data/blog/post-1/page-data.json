I moved to the United States in 1998 to study English. After a year and a half at ESL school, I decided that I wanted to stay so I enrolled in a college in San Francisco, and gained a degree in Hospitality management. Upon graduation, I managed fine dining restaurants for several years in the Bay Area.  I was introduced to coding during the opening of one particular restaurant. I worked with engineers on a point of sale (POS) system to customize the software. They showed me some basic codes so I could change menu items, prices, etc.  Whenever time permitted, mostly on slow nights, I would sit in front of the computer and try to troubleshoot issues that the engineers hadn\\u2019t taught me about. A few were successful, most were not. But, the failed attempts didn\\u2019t matter. I remember how curious it made me, and how excited I got when the code I wrote made it do the things that I needed it to do.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"That was 11 years ago. During that time, I found and married the love of my life and birthed two beautiful and energetic, answer seeking boys. Since the start of my family, I\\u2019ve been a stay-at-home mom and have been working part-time out of our home. Raising a family has been the most challenging yet amazing thing I\\u2019ve ever done, but I was starting to feel like I was losing my own identity in everyday motherhood. Through some miracle, I found coding again.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There is an amazing organization called Moms Can: CODE. Moms Can: CODE is a community that provides moms who are learning how to code with learning resources and opportunities to connect. They had their launch party in Pittsburgh last summer and now they have over 800 members in their facebook group. My friend who was interested in learning to code invited me to go with her to the launch party. Since I left my work as a restaurant manager in 2012, I haven\\u2019t written a single line of code. Something told me I should go, so I called my husband, figure out the childcare and went. There was a room full of women, mostly moms who are coders or who are learning to code. It was very inspiring to see all the moms who are in tech or like me, trying to be in tech. I wanted to become one of them. That night, I went home and started coding. Last December, I was taking the Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep Course and found out Moms Can: CODE was partnering with Flatiron School for scholarship opportunities. I applied. I was so thrilled when I found out I was accepted in Full Stack Web Development program with a scholarship!! Since I left my work as a restaurant manager in 2012, I hadn\\u2019t written a single line of code. With some good and great luck, and lots of hard work, I am heading towards becoming a coder. My dreams are coming true!
